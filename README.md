# Content Addressable Memory

Content Addressable Memory (abbr. CAM) is a special type of memory used for intensive search applications. This IP core is completely parameterizable in terms of data width and memory depth. CAM consists of three elements: block CAM, RAM with size DATA_WIDTH x MEMORY_DEPTH, and a lookup table of size (2^DATA_WIDTH) x MEMORY_DEPTH. The purpose of the RAM is to store the data, whereas the lookup table is used for getting the information whether the input data is contained in RAM.
